Antilles is an infrastructure management software for high-performance computing (HPC). It provides features like cluster management and monitoring, job scheduling and management, cluster user management, account management, and file system management.

With Antilles, administrators can manage and monitor user groups, users, and billing groups within a cluster in a centralized manner. They can also schedule and monitor jobs, alerts, and reports, and perform various settings.

With Antilles, users can centralize resource allocation in one supercomputing cluster and carry out HPC jobs. Users can perform operations by logging in to the management system interface with a browser, or by using command lines after logging in to a cluster login node with another Linux shell.
